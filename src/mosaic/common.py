# This is high weirdness to support "stateful" losses (e.g. to interleave recycling and optimization steps).
# The right way to do this is to plumb some output of a loss module as a new argument (e.g. a structure prediction loss that returns
# the trunk state after recycling and takes in an initial trunk state in addition to sequence etc).
# In order to make this all work we need
#   1. a way for a module to indicate that it can be updated
#   2. to get the update from the output of the  _value_and_grad call,
#   3. and finally a way to link the update to the module and call an update method to update the full loss pytree


# The way this is done now is:
#   1. a module has a `state_index` property that is an instance of `StateIndex`
#   2. part of the aux pytree is a tuple of (StateIndex, value) where value is the argument to be passed to the `update_state` method
#   3. the `update_state` method is called for each module in the loss pytree that has a `state_index` property
#   This last step happens in the optimization loop after the value and gradient have been computed.


# As always we should use Patrick's elegant approach from equinox instead but I can't bring myself to pass additional arguments to all loss functions.

    The aux pytree should contain a tuple of (StateIndex, value) where value is the argument to be passed to the `update_state` method.

    See `is_state_update` and `has_state_index` for how to use this.
